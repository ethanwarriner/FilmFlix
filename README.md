# FilmFlix
Personal version of a collaborative project at Ontario Tech University.

<div style="text-align: justify;">
FilmFlix is a movie database cataloguing system designed to manage and display a vast collection of movies. It enables users to search, filter, and view detailed information about movies, including genres, release dates, and movie descriptions. Users can also add their favorite movies to a personal list for easy access.

<div style="text-align: justify;">
Admins have enhanced privileges, allowing them to manage the entire movie database. They can add new movies, edit existing movie details, and delete movies that are no longer relevant. The system makes navigation smooth between different user roles, with user-friendly interfaces for browsing and managing movie content.

# My Contributions

I was responsible for the backend development and database integration. My main tasks included:
* Creating **Java classes** and backend logic using **Spring Boot** to let users add and manage movies in the database.
* Setting up and connecting the project to an online **Supabase (PostgreSQL)** database.
* Linking the **frontend** and **backend** so that movie information could be viewed and updated through the website.
* Providing design input and feedback on the user interface and overall flow of the application.
